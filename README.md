#Development #SoloProjects #MediaScrobbler
# About
MediaScrobbler is a Python application which listens to Operating System Media Controls, as opposed to a specific appplication. It verifies authenticity that the track being listened to is actually a music track, and scrobbles the currently playing song to Last.FM

The application utilizes the APIs for Last.FM and MusicBrainz. Last.FM's API provides scrobbling functionality. MusicBrainz API provides a source for valid tracks and artists.
